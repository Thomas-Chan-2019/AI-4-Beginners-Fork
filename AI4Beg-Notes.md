# Lecture 1: Introduction
- Top-down (symbolic reasoning) v.s. Bottom-up (teaching new babies) + more (Genetic Alg, Evolutionary models)
- Some examples:
    - [alpha-beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning)
    - [case-based reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case-based_reasoning)
    - [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) 
        - Relations with DynP and Markov Decision Process (MDP), revisit Systems Engineering course for details
        - RL vs DynP: RL does not use deterministic math. model for running the set of MDP, but the method is similar
